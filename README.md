# StellarisREG
The Stellaris Random Empire Generator. Supports full reverse lookup.

Simple dynamic webpage to generate empires with random settings for Stellaris. No database required. It runs a bit slow because it tests every single property addition against the full set multiple times.
Could probably be optimized, but the choice was made to make rule updates more convenient.
